**Version 2.0 // 2025**

## The Mission

**they own WHAT??** is an investigative and advocacy tool designed to bring transparency to Connecticut's property landscape. By linking fragmented public records, we reveal the hidden networks of ownership that shape our neighborhoods.

## Recent Updates (January 2026)

*   **UI Overhaul:** Modernized interface with glassmorphism design, improved cards, and responsive layout.
*   **Smart Search:** Added instant autocomplete for businesses, owners, and addresses with real-time feedback.

## New Feature: AI Digest

The **AI Digest** performs automated web searches across multiple entities simultaneously to identify:

*   Systemic tenant complaints and property condition issues.
*   Legal violations and court case patterns.
*   Corporate footprints and out-of-state investment trends.
*   Verified news sources and public documentation links.

## Data Sources

*   CT SOTS Business Registry
*   Municipal Parcel & CAMA Records
*   Real-time News Highlights
*   2025 Assessment Data

## How it works

Our system uses name normalization and link-analysis to connect principals to businesses, and businesses to properties, creating a "graph" of ownership that surpasses simple database lookups.

## Transparency Notice

This tool is for informational and advocacy purposes. While we strive for 100% accuracy in our linking logic, users should verify critical findings with primary municipal and state sources.
